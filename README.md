# Almaskhan-Test-Task
 
To play this project, open Assets/Game.unity scene. You can add more resources to produce in the Assets/Resources. You will need to give it a unique name, time to generate this resource, and an icon. There are a few icons in the Assets/Icons folder, but if you want to add more icons, don't forget to set the Texture Type to Sprite (2D and UI) in the Texture2D Import Settings.
